CMPE/CISC 365 Assignment 1

Due Thursday, September 26 at noon.

In this assignment you'll write code to build the convex hull of a set
of 2D points.  Undergraduates may work in groups of two.  Graduate
students must work individually.

1. Get the ch.py code running.  READ ALL OF THE CODE AND UNDERSTAND
   HOW IT WORKS.

2. Modify buildHull() to handle the base cases in which you have two
   or three points.  Test input is in points1.txt and points2.txt.  In
   those cases, you should form the hull directly.  To do so, set the
   'cwPoint' and 'ccwPoint' fields of each of the two or three points.
   These fields should be set to be the points on the hull directly CW
   and CCW of the point in question.  Do not continue to the next step
   until you get this working and have tested it visually.

3. Modify buildHull() to handle the recursive case.  This will take
   time.  At each step of implementation, you should check your
   algorithm with the visual animation.  Read the code comments to see
   how that animation works with the display() function.  Test input
   is in points3.txt, points4.txt, and points5.txt.

4. Modify buildHull() to discard the points that are no longer on the
   hull after each merge.  These points are "discarded" by setting
   their 'cwPoint' and 'ccwPoint' to None.  Do not remove these points
   from the 'allPoints' list.  Be careful NOT TO DISCARD points that
   are on the hull after the merge.

To submit:

   Submit two files with EXACTLY THESE NAMES.

     README.txt - containing the name, student number, and netID of each
                  person working on the assignment.  Include here any
                  comments you have for the TA. 

     main.py    - the modified code, well commented.

   YOU WILL LOSE MARKS IF YOU DO NOT SUBMIT TWO FILES WITH EXACTLY THE
   NAMES ABOVE.

   IN A GROUP OF TWO, ONLY ONE PERSON MAY SUBMIT THE ASSIGNMENT.  IF
   YOUR GROUP SUBMITS TWO ASSIGNMENTS, YOU WILL LOSE MARKS.

For marking, we will read your code for correctness, clarity, and
quality, and we will run your code.
